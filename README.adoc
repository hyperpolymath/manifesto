:description: Codifying 400+ repositories into a unified formal system.

== The Vision
For three decades, I have operated at the intersection of cognitive science , philosophy, and systems engineering. This manifesto marks the transition from private research to the public deployment of the **RSR 2026 (Rhodium Standard Repository)**.

== Core Pillars
1. **Machine-Readable Governance:** Moving beyond human-centric READMEs to the `6SCM` architectural pattern.
2. **Neurosymbolic Verification:** Bridging the gap between the probabilistic nature of LLMs and symbolic mathematical certainty.
3. **Post-Disciplinary Praxis:** Applying the rigour of Cognitive and Decision Sciences  to social and technical systems, from labor union policy [cite: 91, 98] to RISC-V SSGs.

== The Legacy of Axiology
My work in **Axiology** (the study of value) and the **Metaprogramming Turn** [cite: 66, 76] culminates here. We do not just write code; we architect value-driven logic.
